    "# Lab 3: Shift Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modeling a scheduling problem using mixed-integer programming (MIP). (Model)\n",
    "- Expressing logical constraints using binary variables and index notation. (Analyze)\n",
    "- Linearizing non-linear constraints. (Analyze)\n",
    "- Implementing a large scale integer program using Gurobi. (Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Trevon is in charge of scheduling shifts for all nurses at the emergency department at Trojan community hospital. In order to help the hospital retain quality staff, Trevon would like to create schedules that treat all nurses fairly and satisfy their preferences as much as possible. In the past, he spent many painstaking hours scheduling by hand, but he feels that the schedules can still be improved. Recently, Trevon learned about mixed-integer programming (MIP) in a course he is taking at USC. He would like to apply his knowledge to create better schedules for the nurses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shifts are scheduled $n$ weeks at a time (beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday). ($n$ is a parameter that can be inferred from the input data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shift requirements:** There are three nurse shifts in a day: morning, evening, and nights. Each shift should have exactly a certain number of nurses, which is specified in the input file in the sheet called \"Requirements\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scheduling constraints:** Based on hospital and union regulations, no nurse can be assigned more than 6 shifts in a calendar week (Sunday to Saturday). Moreover, no nurse may be scheduled to consecutive shifts. For example, it is not allowed to assign a certain nurse both the morning and the evening shift of the same day. In addition, if a nurse works in a night shift, he/she must take the two prior shifts off as well as the two next shifts off. For example, if a nurse works Tuesday night, then he or she cannot work that Tuesday's morning or evening, nor can she work on Wednesday morning or evening. In other words, you must give her two shifts worth of time to sleep before and after the night shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each nurse can blackout a certain number of shifts, which means that he/she cannot make those shifts under any circumstances (due to vacations and personal conflicts). To blackout a shift, the nurse would specify \"0\" for the corresponding shift in the nurse's preferences, which is given in the sheet called \"Preferences\" and is described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nurse Preferences:** For each shift, a nurse may indicate a preference score of 0, 1, or 2. A score of 0 indicates that the shift is blacked-out, and he/she cannot be assigned to it. A score of 1 indicates that the time is not preferred, but the nurse is willing to work if needed. A score of 2 indicates a preferred time slot. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Trevon would like to maximize the following objective, subject to satisfying all shift requirements and scheduling constraints,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{(Sum of preference scores)}-100 \\times \\text{(shift inequality)} -150\\times \\text{night inequality}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sum of preference scores**: for each shift, add up the preference scores of all nurses assigned to the shift. Then sum over all shifts in the 9 week scheduling period.\n",
    "- **Shift inequality**: the maximum number of shifts worked by any nurse in the entire period represented by the input data file, minus the minimum number of shifts worked by any nurse.\n",
    "- **Night inequality**: the maximum number of night shifts worked by any nurse in the entire period, minus the minimum number of night shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help Trevon formulate a mixed-integer program (MIP) using proper mathematical formulation and find an optimal schedule for his input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following files are associated with this lab and can be downloaded from Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data.xlsx:** the main input file for this lab. There are two sheets. The sheet \"Preferences\" contains the preference score submissions of all nurses for each shift. The sheet \"Requirements\" contains the number of nurses required for each shift.\n",
    "- **small_data.xlsx:** a smaller dataset of the same format as the above, for development purposes.\n",
    "- **output_for_small_data.xlsx:** a correct optimization output using the input file \"small_data.xlsx\". (There may be other correct optimal schedules that achieve the same objective but with different assignments.) See Section 3.2 for a description of the output file.\n",
    "- **grade_lab3.py:**  the grading script that will be used to assess your schedule (see instructions in Section 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Reading and writing data with MultiIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code illustrates   how to do the proper file input and output for this lab. The code first reads the \"Preferences\" sheet from \"small_data.xlsx\", which has multiple rows representing a column header (represented as a MultiIndex object in Python). The code then  replace the MultiIndex by a numerical index, which makes it more manageable. Finally, the code creates a partial schedule using the MultiIndex, as well as fake summary statistics and save to \"tmp.xlsx\". This gives you an idea of how to create the output files so that it has the required format."
