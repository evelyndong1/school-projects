    "# Instructions for Installation Gurobi (complete before class on 2/25)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gurobi is a state-of-the-art optimization software that interfaces with Python, which we will use for the optimization portion of the course. **Step 3 need to be completed while you are physically on campus, as it requires an .edu domain.** An alternative is to setup USC VPN and complete it while on VPN. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Installing Gurobi via conda\n",
    "In Anaconda prompt (Windows) or in a terminal (Mac or Linux), type: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi gurobi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Type yes for everything to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Request a free academic license on Gurobi.com\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use your `.edu` email address to register on Gurobi.com as an academic user, using this link: http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/user/licenses/free-academic\n",
    "\n",
    "After registering and logging in, visit the above link again and request a free individual-level academic license.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Download the license file while using USC WIFI via `grbgetkey` command in Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the license, you should log in to the Gurobi website and navigate to your license and follow the instructions there to run the given `grbgetkey` command in Anaconda prompt (in Windows) or a Terminal (in Mac or Linux) followed by your license code. An example is as follows, but you need to replace the long string with your personal license key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "grbgetkey ae36ac20-16e6-acd2-f242-4da6e765fa0a\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "**Your computer needs to be accessing Internet using the USC network for this step to work. (You must do this step on campus.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4. Test your installation by running the following code using Jupyter notebook.\n",
