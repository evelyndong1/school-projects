    "\n",
    "Shannon Faris is the Assistant Dean of Institutional Research and Academic Administration at the USC Marshall School of Business. She and her colleague Hal Warning from the Marshall Office of Finance and Administration are in charge of coordinating classroom scheduling for the entire business school, which has 7 departments, 22 academic programs, and enrollment of around 5000 undergraduate students and 1000 graduate students. Since taking charge of the scheduling process in 2016, they have been implementing a series of reforms on course scheduling to improve efficiency and transparency. While they have already conducted extensive analysis on the current schedules and scheduling process, they are innovative managers who are open to explore the potential benefits of advanced business analytics techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your team has been hired as elite consultants to investigate the possibility of applying optimization to improve the current system and to rigorously quantify the potential gains.** How you go about this task is open-ended: you can be creative in what part of the current system to introduce optimization, how to measure success, and how to implement the optimization. But you must be able to justify these choices and defend your assumptions. You will present your findings to Shannon and her team, as well as document your methodology and results in a report that will be scrutinized over by both senior administrators and data analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Status Quo\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduling of courses and classrooms at USC Marshall begins almost one year before the semester begins. For courses in the fall 2018 semester, Shannon and her team would allocate to each department coordinator a set of classroom-time slots at the beginning of fall 2017. For spring 2019, the initial allocation is made at the beginning of spring 2018. These slots are based on the historical allocation for courses from that department, as well as on any special requests from the department coordinators. Each slot indicates a classroom as well as a time period in the week. (i.e. JKP 102 on Mondays at 2-4pm.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Marshall has seven departments, each with its own scheduling coordinator, who is typically the head administrator for that department. The seven departments along with their commonly used abbreviations are as follows: Business Communication (BUCO), Data Sciences and Operations (DSO), Finance and Business Economics (FBE), Leventhal School of Accounting (ACCT), Management and Organization (MOR), Marketing (MKT), and Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies (BAEP). \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon receiving the initial allocation of time slots from Shannon’s team, each department coordinator has a few months to populate the slots with courses, working in cooperation with the chair of the department, who assigns teaching duties to individual professors. For concreteness, we refer to this as Phase I of the classroom scheduling process. The current assignment of courses is largely based on historical schedules. However, changes must be made when there are new courses or new sections of existing courses that need to be allocated. Classrooms also have different sizes and capabilities, and the allocation should satisfy the particular needs of each course. During the scheduling process, individual professors may also reach out to the department coordinator to indicate preferences for teaching times. However, this is done at an ad-hoc basis and there is currently no systematic way of eliciting and accommodating faculty preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "After Phase I ends, any unused slots become open for any department to use. Over the next few months before the semester begins, the department coordinators work with Shannon and her team to schedule the remaining courses. We refer to this as Phase II of the scheduling process. Preferences for classrooms and times become increasingly difficult to accommodate during Phase II as previously available slots become taken. At this time, Shannon’s team may need to find potential swaps of course times in order to find a feasible allocation that satisfies all courses. The schedule must be finalized before the student course selection process begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, a significant fraction of courses and sections are not scheduled by the end of Phase I. This implies a lot of last minute scrambling and headaches for certain departments to schedule the remaining courses. In rare cases, the classroom may still be unassigned at the time students choose classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since taking ownership of the scheduling process, they have been trying to increase the transparency of the communications with department coordinators, increase the percentage of courses that are scheduled by the end of Phase 1, and apply evidence-based decision making. They are constantly analyzing the historical and current schedules to identify possible improvements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Desirable Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, a course scheduling system should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiently utilize the available space to schedule all courses and output a feasible schedule on time, well before registration starts. This is projected to become more difficult in the future as demand for Marshall courses is expected to rise, but the school does not have the resources to build additional classrooms due to land restrictions. If efficiency does not rise through optimization, then Marshall may be forced to increasingly schedule classes during early morning or late evening hours, which may be unpopular to the majority of students and faculty.\n",
    "- Satisfy the preferences and needs of students as much as possible, so that they are able to successfully schedule all their required courses as well as the electives that they most desire. Students also have preferences for certain time of day that should be satisfied as much as possible.\n",
    "- Satisfy the preferences of faculty as much as possible. For example, most faculty prefer to teach everything on the same day, so they do not have to teach every day of the week. Moreover, many faculty prefer not to teach in the evenings, although some actually prefer evenings to avoid traffic. It’s best to match the times with faculty preferences, so as to improve the work environment for faculty and help Marshall to recruit and retain the best.\n",
    "- Be transparent and fair in how it satisfies student and faculty preferences, so that certain groups are not discriminated against.\n",
    "- Limit the administrative effort needed by Shannon’s team and by department coordinators, who also have other roles to fill.\n",
    "- Adapt to the changing needs of the students and faculty, as the set of courses and the demand for each course changes from one year to the next, and there may be changes in the composition of students as well as turnover among faculty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Institutional Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The department coordinators are currently overtaxed in general, so any recommendation that requires additional time and effort from them has a low chance of being adopted. On the contrast, anything that would save them significant time and effort is appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a recommendation that can be easily incorporated into the current work flow has a much better chance of being implemented than a recommendation that requires large changes. For example, it is conceivable that Shannon’s team may adopt a decision support tool that recommends a schedule that they can tweak; but it’s hard to imagine that they would accept a black-box system that allows no human feedback and simply outputs an \"optimized\" schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the school leadership is open to innovative ideas that improve the status quo, it also wishes to minimize the risk of disrupting normal operations. As a result, a series of gradual improvements is easier to accept than a sudden large-scale revamp. Furthermore, it is important to be able to quantify the potential for improvement in a rigorous way, so as to make sure that any changes will be worth the efforts. The school will not make any changes outright without convincing evidence of its benefit."

    "### 2.5 MBA Student Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spring 2018, USC Marshall experimented with using a new course selection system called CourseMatch, in which students indicated their preference over all courses, and a special algorithm determined the assignment. For various reasons, USC did not continue using the system for subsequent semesters, but the data collected for this semester gives insights on student preferences. (In other semesters, we only observe which courses students enrolled in, but not which courses they would like to enroll in and how much they like each course.) However, this system was only used by full-time MBA, part-time MBA and iBEAR students. The columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **student_id**: a scrambled version of the student ID.\n",
    "- **units**: the total number of units the student is expected to enroll in that semester.\n",
    "- **year**: whether the student is a year 1 MBA or year 2 MBA student.\n",
    "- **ranking_class**: 4 denotes that the course is the student's \"Favorite,\" 3 denotes \"Great,\" 2 denotes \"Good\" and 1 denotes \"acceptable.\"\n",
    "- **total_rank**: 1 denotes the course being the student's top choice, 2 denotes the second choice and so on.\n",
    "- **class_rank**: ranking of course within the same \"ranking_class.\" For example, if a student selected three courses as \"Great\" (ranking_class=3), then 1 denotes the course being the student's favorite among the three, and 2 denotes the second favorite among the three, and so on.\n",
    "- **course_id**, **slug**, **longname**: informaiton about the course and section. Some sections have been split into two virtual sections to control the relative proportion of students from different programs.\n",
    "- **night**, **meetingday1**, **meetingtime1**, **meetinglocation1**: information about the timing of the course and section: whether the course meets in the evening, what day of the week it meets, time of meeting, and room.\n",
    "- **allocated**: binary indicator for whether the student got the course/section.\n",
    "- **price**: the CourseMatch system is based on simulating a virtual auction, and the price gives information on how many virtual points a course costs. Higher prices means that the demand is high compared to the supply.\n",
    "- **count**, **max_capacity**: the number of students enrolled in the course, and the number of seats offered."

    "**2. Opportunity for Improvement**: What is the main weakness or inefficiency in the current process of classroom scheduling that you choose to focus on in your project? You must illustrate this weakness or inefficiency either by analyzing existing data, or by conducting a simulation analysis with reasonable assumptions. (Either data analysis or simulation can suffice, but you cannot simply claim the weakness without justificaiton.)\n",

You need to quantify the potential gains from applying your optimization methodology. Furthermore, you need to provide qualitative intuition on where the gains come from and why your outputs make sense. You should also illustrate what qualitative insights can be learned from using your optimization. For any claims you make, you must rigorously justify them based on sound reasoning and reference to supporting analysis.

    "    import sys\n",
    "    print (f'Running {sys.argv[0]} using argument list {sys.argv}')\n",

    "Your submitted Python module will be graded on correctness and ease of being understood. For the latter, you should include appropriate docstrings to all functions, write comments to explain the logic, and use intuitive variable names.\n",

    "### 3.4 Sample input (.xlsx or .csv file)\n",
    "One or more sample input files that can be fed into your optimization code. Your optimization code should be flexible enough such that one can use it simply by changing the input file, and not have to alter anything in the code. You should avoid hardcoding any parameters into the code, but try to read all parameters from the input files.\n",

    "### 3.6 Documentation of optimization tool (.txt, .pdf or .docx)\n",
    "A text file describing how to use your optimization module. You should explain how a user can run your code from the command line, as well as what functions to import into Jupyter notebook. This needs to be sufficiently clear so someone with very little knowledge of Python can use your tool. \n",

    "## 4. Grading Rubrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Project report (25% of course grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "The report is out of a maximum of 30 points, with 3 points being distributed in each of the following 10 categories. What is needed to obtain a perfect score in each category is described below. Within each category, there is a 0.5 point deduction for every minor issue and a 1 point deduction for every major issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Executive summary:** The executive summary clearly and concisely summarizes the main findings of the report, including the inefficiency found, the potential gain from optimization, and the final recommendation. The writing is polished and free from spelling or grammar issues, with appropriate words and well-formed paragraphs. The overall look is professional and the formatting should be clean and consistent. The main message of the report can be quickly grasped by a busy executive. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Opportunity for improvement:** Clear and precise description of what is the inefficiency in the status quo you found. The description of the opportunity for improvement should be compelling, but the magnitude of the inefficiency should not be oversold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Rigour in justifying opportunity for improvement:** The identified opportunity for improvement is convincingly illustrated using either data analysis or simulation. Moreover, the analysis is rigorous and free from errors and statistical fallacies. The way you conducted the data analysis or set up the simulation is clearly explained so the overall idea is clear to readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Clarity of methodology:** The required inputs, outputs, as well as the decision variables, objective, and constraints are clearly described. The language should target a non-technical but business saavy executive, with minimal mathematical notation or technical jargon. (The technical details should be deferred to the Appendix.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Clarity of results:** The optimization results and insights are clearly presented. If tables,  figures or plots are used, they should be easy to read, easy to understand, fully and appropriately labeled, and clearly described. There should not be unnecessary, distracting, or unprofessional looking visuals. Furthermore, the potential gain from using your optimization tool is clearly articulated, as well as qualitative intuition on where the gains may come from and why they make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Rigour of results:** The interpretation of the numerical results is correct and any claim of potential gain or insight found is convincingly justified by the presented supporting evidence. The result is not oversold, and the logic of the analysis and its explanation is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Discussion of methodology:** The reason behind the chocie of input and output data, as well as the decision variables, objectives, and constraints are clearly described and the logic is sound. The main assumptions are clearly and thoroughly articulated. The weaknesses of the analysis are clearly acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Discussion of recommendation:** The finall recommendation is clearly stated and explained. The issues that are not captured by your model are accounted for, and your recommendation and explanation make business sense (showing street smarts). \n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Correctness of mathematical formulation:** The input data, decision variables, objectives, and constraints are clearly expressed by appropriate, precise and correct mathematical language. All formula and mathematical notation should be rendered nicely. Furthermore, the mathematical formulation correctly implements the English description in the main body. \n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Discussion of technical details:** The potentially problematic technical details in the analysis are identified and precisely described. The reasoning behind these technical choices are clearly presented and the remaining weak points and gaps are acknowledged. There are no large weaknesses or gaps in the analysis that are not mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Python code and documentation (5% of course grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization tool (3.3), documentation (3.2 and 3.6), and data files (3.4 and 3.5) are graded together using the following rubric. There is a maximum of 15 points, with 3 points for each of the following categories. What is needed to obtain a perfect score in each category is described below. Within each category, there is an one point deduction for every  minor issue, and a two point deduction for every major issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Correctness:** Code implements what is claimed without syntax or logical errors. The code can be run on another computer without error. All the features described in the documentation (see 3.6) works. Code correctly runs on the sample input (3.4) and produces the sample output (3.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Scalability:** Code is able to be scaled up to the size of inputs that is needed for the actual business context, within a reasonable runtime, while obtaining a good solution. The optimization formulation is reasonably efficient (cannot do the same thing with many fewer decision variables or constraints.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Usability:** The inputs needed to run the code can be plausibly obtained by the end user within a reasonable amount of effort. The functionality of the code matches the need of the end user. While the expectations of the code is that it is only a prototype, it should be something that USC Marshall would be interested to develop further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Readability:** The code includes appropriate docstrings for all functions, and enough comments so a trained analyst can understand it easily. The variable names should be appropriate and there should not be extraneous logic that has little functionality but may confuse the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Completeness of documentation and data files:** The documentation of plots and figures (see 3.2) and the documentation of the optimization tool (see 3.6) contain all of the required components: explanation with enough detail to reproduce every numerical estimate, table or plot in the main body; instructions with examples of how to use the optimization tool both from Jupyter notebook and from the command line; explanation of the format and significance of every piece of the sample input and output data. Moreover, all of the input files needed to run the code are attached to the submission. Moreover, the sample output that would be created by the code is also given. All of these should match the high-level description in the project report and the detailed description in the documentation (see 3.6).\n"
