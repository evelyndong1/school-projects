    "The key is to recognize that the following 8 outcomes are equally likely: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, and TTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** $P(HHT) = 1/8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** $P(HHH) + P(HHT) = 2/8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** $P(HHH) + P(HHT) + P(THH) = 3/8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** $P(HHH)+P(HTH)+P(THT)+P(TTT) = 4/8 = 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to see is that since the third toss is independent of the first, for any realization of the first toss, the chance that the third toss obtains the same outcome must be 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Let $X_1$ be 1 if the first toss is heads and 0 otherwise. Note that $E[X_1]=1\\cdot P(\\text{first toss heads})=1/2$. Similarly define $X_2$ and $X_3$. Let $X$ be the number of total heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = E[X_1+X_2+X_3]=E[X_1]+E[X_2]+E[X_3] = 3/2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** Let $X$ be the number of total occurrences of \"HH.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{cases} 2 & \\text{if HHH,} \\\\\n",
    "1 & \\text{if HHT or THH,} \\\\\n",
