    "## Warm Up: Optimal Team Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob and Alice work together as a husband and wife team to make specialized crafts which they sell on Etsy.com. After months of experimentation, they figured out that there are two kinds of products they can make which have high demands. Alice can make an ornamental bracelet by herself in one hour, which makes a profit of 100 dollars per unit. They can also team up to make a wooden toy house, which makes a profit of 300 dollars per unit, but each requires two hours of work by Alice and three hours of work by Bob. Suppose that they can each work six hours per day. What is the maximum profit per day they can make together as a family and how would they achieve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** If $X$ is the number of units of the ornamental bracelet the family makes per day and $Y$ the number of units of the wooden toy house, what combinations of $(X,Y)$ are possible? Enumerate as many as you can by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Plot all the feasible $(X,Y)$ combinations in a two-dimensional graph (with $X$ being on the horizontal axis and $Y$ on the vertical axis). What is the optimal combination and the associated profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** How would the answer change if each unit of the ornamental bracelet makes a profit of 200 dollars (instead of 100)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** How would the answer change if Alice works an additional hour per day? (Profit of ornamental bracelet is still 100 dollars.)"
